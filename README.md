# ‚õîÔ∏è Sentiment Analysis Model Collections

This repository contains machine learning models of Sentiment Analysis, designed to be deployed using ONNX and utilized in a Streamlit-based web application. The app provides an interactive interface for performing various tasks using neural network architectures. [Check here to see other ML tasks](https://github.com/verneylmavt/ml-model).

For more information about the training process, please check the `.ipynb` files in the `training` folder.

## üéà Demo App

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running Locally

If the demo page is not working, you can fork or clone this repository and run the application locally by following these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or later
- pip (Python Package Installer)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/verneylmavt/st-snt-analysis.git
   cd st-snt-analysis
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

Alternatively you can run `demo.ipynb` for a minimal setup to quickly test the model (implemented w/ `ipywidgets`).

<!-- ### Notes

- Ensure all required model files (ONNX models, vocabulary files, etc.) are placed in the appropriate directories as referenced in the app.
- If you encounter issues, check the error logs and ensure all dependencies are correctly installed. -->
<!--

## Features
